* -- Overview --
     * For our 1.2.10 madLibs project, we've decided to base it off of the holiday Halloween to create a fun and spooky environment.
     * Our project consists of an algorithm with a file named "madLibs.java" that prompts the user to enter different nouns, verbs, and adjectives to create a fun madLibs.
 
* -- Our steps to success--
     1. Create algorithm
     2. Start off by importing Scanner class and creating a public class and main method
     3. Create a method solely for the story template
     4. Initiate variables and create while loops that continue to ask user to input word types until there are no more left
     5. Replace any word in the angle brackets with the user input.
     6. Print out new story with user inputs
     7. Create three new methods that count number of nouns, verbs, and adjectives used.
     8. Print out results.
     9. Finish algorithm
     10. Create google slides and README.
     11. Work on an exciting and fun presentation
        
* -- Coding details --
     * Consists of 5 different methods:
        * Three integer methods for counting the number of nouns, verbs, and adjectives
        * One main method for user input
        * One string method for the story template
     * Asks the user to input nouns, verbs, and adjectives
     * Parses strings
* -- Extra add-ons we created --
     * Shows the number of nouns, verbs, and adjectives used in the entire story by creating different methods
     * Code has while loops, for loops, and if statements
* -- Application to real life --
     * Can be used as a fun activity to do when bored
     * Helps children learn different types of words
     * Enhances reading skills
     * Can be used as a start-up or template for books
