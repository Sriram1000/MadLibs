# SPOOKY HALLOWEEN MADLIBS
* -- Overview --
     * For our 1.2.10 madLibs project, we've decided to base it off of the holiday Halloween to create a fun and spooky environment.
     * Our project consists of an algorithm with a file named "madLibs.java" that prompts the user to enter different nouns, verbs, and adjectives to create a fun madLibs.
* -- Coding details --
     * Consists of 5 different methods:
        * Three integer methods for counting the number of nouns, verbs, and adjectives
        * One main method for user input
        * One string method for the story template
     * Asks the user to input nouns, verbs, and adjectives
     * Parses strings
* -- Extra add-ons we created --
     * Shows the number of nouns, verbs, and adjectives used in the entire story by creating different methods
     * Code has while loops, for loops, and if statements
* -- Application to real life --
     * Can be used as a fun activity to do when bored
     * Helps children learn different types of words
     * Enhances reading skills
     * Can be used as a start-up or template for books
